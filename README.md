### **Problem Statement: Tic-Tac-Toe**

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The game follows these rules:

1. The game involves two players: **Player 1 (X)** and **Player 2 (O)**.
2. Players take turns placing their respective marks (**X** or **O**) on an empty cell in the 3x3 grid.
3. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three identical marks.
4. The game ends when:
   - A player achieves three marks in a row, column, or diagonal (that player wins).
   - The grid is completely filled without a winner (resulting in a draw).
5. The game starts with an empty board, and moves are made alternately by the players.

### **Requirements:**
- The game should allow players to input their moves.
- It should check for valid moves (i.e., preventing moves in occupied cells).
- The game should determine the winner or declare a draw.
- It should provide a way to restart or exit.
